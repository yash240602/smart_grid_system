# Smart Grid Optimization System - Demo Script

## Introduction (1 minute)

"Today I'm demonstrating the Smart Grid Optimization System, a modern solution that combines electrical engineering fundamentals with cutting-edge software and machine learning techniques."

## System Architecture Overview (2 minutes)

"The system consists of three main components:
1. The **Power Grid Simulation** module - simulates an electrical grid using Ohm's Law and Kirchhoff's Voltage Law
2. A **C++ Load Scheduler** - efficiently manages load priorities
3. An **ML Pipeline** - predicts voltage and detects anomalies
4. A **Modern React Frontend** - visualizes everything in real-time"

## Frontend Demonstration (4 minutes)

"Let me show you the frontend interface that operators would use to monitor and manage the grid."

1. **Login Screen**
   - "The system features JWT authentication for security"
   - [Navigate past login screen]

2. **Dashboard Overview**
   - "This is the main dashboard where operators can monitor the entire grid at a glance"
   - "The left panel shows a force-directed graph of the grid topology"
   - "The right panel shows real-time voltage data with predictions"
   - "The bottom section would allow for load scheduling"

3. **Grid Visualization**
   - "Nodes are color-coded by voltage level - blue for high voltage, green for medium, orange for low"
   - "Lines show connections, with thickness representing current flow"
   - "Red flashing nodes indicate detected anomalies"
   - [Click on different nodes] "Clicking on a node shows detailed information and updates the charts"

4. **Voltage Monitoring**
   - "This chart shows historical voltage data with anomaly detection"
   - "The green dotted line represents ML predictions for future values"
   - "The shaded area shows prediction confidence intervals"
   - "Red X marks indicate detected anomalies that could require attention"

## ML Capabilities Demonstration (3 minutes)

"Behind the UI, the system uses machine learning for two key functions:"

1. **Show Anomaly Detection**
   - "I've prepared some sample data with voltage anomalies"
   - [Show sample_data/ML_RESULTS.md] "Our DBSCAN algorithm detected these anomalies"
   - "In a real deployment, this would trigger alerts and highlight the problematic grid sections"

2. **Show Prediction Capabilities**
   - "The system also uses LSTM neural networks to predict future voltage values"
   - "This helps operators anticipate issues before they occur"
   - "The model achieves 96.3% accuracy within Â±2V, which is sufficient for practical grid management"

## Backend Architecture (2 minutes)

"The system is built on modern technologies:
- FastAPI for high-performance API endpoints
- WebSockets for real-time data streaming
- React with TypeScript for a type-safe frontend
- TensorFlow for the ML pipeline
- C++ for performance-critical load scheduling"

"The backend also includes REST APIs for integration with other systems, and a WebSocket server for pushing real-time updates."

## Conclusion (1 minute)

"This Smart Grid Optimization System demonstrates how modern software techniques can be applied to traditional electrical engineering problems. The combination of:
- Interactive visualization
- Real-time monitoring
- Machine learning predictions
- Anomaly detection

Creates a powerful tool for grid operators that can improve efficiency, reduce outages, and support the integration of renewable energy sources."
