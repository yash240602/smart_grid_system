# How to Share GridGenius with Your Team

Hello Yash,

Here's a complete guide on how to share your GridGenius project with Yashraj and Aarya.

## What's Already Set Up

1. I've created custom branches for both team members:
   - `yashraj-contribution`: Highlights Yashraj's contributions
   - `aarya-contribution`: Highlights Aarya's contributions

2. Both branches have been pushed to your GitHub repository:
   - https://github.com/yash240602/smart_grid_system/tree/yashraj-contribution
   - https://github.com/yash240602/smart_grid_system/tree/aarya-contribution

3. I've prepared ZIP files and instructions in the `exports` directory.

## Option 1: Send Them the Link (Easiest)

Simply share these links with your team members:

- For Yashraj: "Fork this repository and check out the yashraj-contribution branch: https://github.com/yash240602/smart_grid_system/tree/yashraj-contribution"

- For Aarya: "Fork this repository and check out the aarya-contribution branch: https://github.com/yash240602/smart_grid_system/tree/aarya-contribution"

## Option 2: Send Them the ZIP Files

1. Compress the `exports` directory:
   ```
   zip -r team_exports.zip exports/
   ```

2. Share the ZIP file with Yashraj and Aarya via email, Google Drive, or any other file-sharing method.

3. Tell them to follow the instructions in the INSTRUCTIONS.md files.

## What's Included in Their Versions

### For Yashraj:
- README highlighting his contributions to Dashboard visualization
- Code comments in Dashboard component attributing work to him
- Instructions for setting up his own repository and deployment

### For Aarya:
- README highlighting his contributions to ML components
- Code comments in ML components attributing work to him
- Instructions for setting up his own repository and deployment

## Follow-up

After they've set up their repositories, suggest they:

1. Update their GitHub profile to feature this project
2. Include the project on their resume with details about their specific contributions
3. Consider setting up Vercel deployments for easier demo access

Let me know if you need any other assistance with sharing the project!
