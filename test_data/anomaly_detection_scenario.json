  "explanation": {
    "method": "The isolation forest algorithm detected these anomalies by isolating observations that are different from the normal patterns. The contamination factor of 0.05 means we expect about 5% of the data to be anomalous.",
    "analysis": "Four distinct types of power quality issues were detected across different nodes in the grid. The most severe was the harmonic distortion at the industrial node IND1, with an anomaly score of 0.95, likely caused by new manufacturing equipment.",
    "recommendations": [
      "Install power quality monitors at IND1 to track harmonic distortion issues",
      "Review the synchronization parameters of residential PV inverters connected to RES1",
      "Investigate the coordination between PP2 generation and COM1 load patterns",
